### Usage
1) Copy *weather.min.css* and the two files *rain.png* and *snow.png* to your page's directory.  
2) Add the following line to your HTML `<head>` tag:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="weather.min.css">
```
3) Now you can use any container with `class="weather rain"` or `class="weather snow"` and it will snow or rain inside it! ;)
